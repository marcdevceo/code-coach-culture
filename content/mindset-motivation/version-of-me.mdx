<h3 className="italic text-center mb-12">Not every part of your greatness is meant to be visible — yet.</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Those who know me professionally would probably say I'm a good guy. Respectful. Creative. A strong leader. And while that's true, it's not the whole story. There's a version of me — and a version of you — that no one has fully seen yet. A version that's been quietly forming, growing, and waiting for its moment.

## The Hidden Space You're Called to Occupy

<h3 className="mb-8">
  There’s a space you were built to fill — a calling that's bigger than what others currently see. Some people might catch glimpses of it. Many won't. And that's okay. Your destiny isn't based on their validation. It's based on your willingness to trust that unseen version of yourself and to keep walking toward it, even when no one else fully understands.

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-pink-600 pl-4 italic text-xl mb-8">
  "There’s a version of you that only God knows — and you're growing into it every day."
</blockquote>

## Move with Intention, Not Permission

<h3 className="mb-8">
  You can't wait for people to validate what they can't see yet. The unseen version of you requires faith, not applause. It demands that you move intentionally — preparing for the opportunities, sharpening your gifts, making the space your own long before the spotlight ever hits it.
</h3>

## Trust the Timing

<h3 className="mb-8">
  There’s a right time, a right door, a right moment when what’s been hidden will be revealed. You don't have to force it. You don't have to rush it. Stay faithful in your growth, and trust that when the time comes, the world will see what God always knew.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  Keep showing up. Keep becoming. The version of you the world hasn't seen yet is the one you've been preparing for all along.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
</h3>
