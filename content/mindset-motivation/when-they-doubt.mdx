<h3 className="text-lg italic text-center mb-12">
  If God has purposed it for you, then nothing — and no one — can stop it.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  There comes a moment in your journey where you have to quiet the noise. Not
  everyone will understand what you’re building. Not everyone will believe in
  the vision you’ve been given. And if we’re being real — some people don’t want
  to see you win at all. That’s just truth.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Don’t Give Up on Yourself</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  It’s easy to throw in the towel when you feel overlooked, underestimated, or
  unsupported. But your value isn’t based on other people’s validation. The
  belief you carry about your purpose has to be louder than the doubt that
  surrounds it.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Believe in the Impossible</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  Impossible doesn’t mean unachievable — it just means unproven. Until you prove
  it. Some of the greatest breakthroughs happen when nobody else is watching.
  You don’t need everyone to believe in your next move. You just need to move
  like it’s already yours.
</h3>

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-pink-600 pl-4 italic text-xl mb-8">
  "If God has spoken it over your life, it’s already settled. Now walk in it."
</blockquote>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Let God Guide You</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  If you’re a believer, you know the voice of the Most High is not loud — it’s
  still, it’s sure, and it cuts through the noise. Follow it. Trust it. The road
  may not be easy, but it will be purposeful. People may doubt, but you’re not
  here to be impressive — you’re here to be obedient.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-12">
  You were built for more. Don’t give up. Don’t shrink back. Keep moving. The
  promise is already on your name — you just have to walk it out.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
</h3>
