  Sometimes stepping back is the boldest move you can make.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  Originally, this post was going to be about debugging code at 2 a.m. —
  but the deeper lesson hit me harder. One of the greatest skills I've
  learned on this journey of becoming a software developer is knowing when
  to walk away and reset my mind. And not just in coding — but in
  leadership, in friendships, in life.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Stepping Back to Move Forward</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  Almost every time I hit a wall with coding, stepping away for 30 minutes
  to an hour gave me the breakthrough I needed. Fresh eyes. A calmer mind.
  A solution that felt invisible before suddenly became obvious. Walking
  away isn’t quitting — it's clearing space for clarity.

  Leadership Means Knowing When to Pause
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  This principle doesn’t just apply to coding — it applies to people. As a
  leader, sometimes the strongest thing you can do is step back before
  reacting. Let emotions cool. Reflect before responding. You’re not
  avoiding the issue; you’re preparing to handle it with grace, not with
  heat.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
  Strength Is Found in Self-Control
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  We live in a world that encourages quick reactions — "Get them before
  they get you." But real strength is about seeing beyond the moment. It’s
  about protecting relationships, preserving team unity, and staying
  focused on the ultimate goal, not just the immediate emotion.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-12">
  So walk away when you need to. Reset your mind. Come back stronger.
  Grace solves what anger only complicates.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
