  Before you can navigate the journey, you have to know where you're starting from.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  At some point, every one of us faces the mirror and asks the simplest — and hardest — question: Who am I? And who am I becoming? These questions aren't just reflective — they're directional. They reveal not just where you are, but where you're headed.

## Lost Without a Map

<h3 className="mb-8">
  For years, I lived with an invisible weight. I had goals, dreams, destinations in mind — but I didn't truly understand where I was starting from. I thought I was "this" but I was actually "that." And that confusion kept me circling the same waters, stuck in the same cycles. I wasn't growing into my leadership — I was just riding whatever wave came by, hoping for the best.

  "If you don't know where you are, and you don't know where you're going, you're just lost in the journey in-between."

## It's Not a Work Ethic Issue — It's an Identity Issue

<h3 className="mb-8">
  I used to think my problem was discipline. That if I just worked harder, I'd find my way. But the truth was deeper: I didn't have a clear sense of who I was, what I valued, or what kind of leader I wanted to become. Without clarity on my identity, every action felt disconnected. Growth became impossible because the foundation was missing.
</h3>

## Clarity Creates Movement

<h3 className="mb-8">
  True progress starts when you answer those two questions honestly. Who are you right now — without the titles, the masks, the expectations? And who are you becoming — by choice, not by default? When you find that clarity, every step forward becomes intentional. You stop drifting. You start leading — first yourself, then others.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  Stop floating through life waiting for a wave to carry you somewhere good. Look in the mirror. Ask yourself the hard questions. Find your starting point. Choose your destination. Then lead yourself there.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
