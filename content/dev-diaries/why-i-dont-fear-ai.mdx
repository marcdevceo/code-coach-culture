  AI isn’t here to replace you — it’s here to level you up.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  For the last two years, I’ve seen the headlines. I’ve read the comments.
  "AI is taking over." "Developers are losing their jobs." I’d be lying if
  I said the fear didn’t get to me. There was a moment when I thought
  about giving up on my journey to become a software developer. What's the
  point if AI is just going to replace me?

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Quieting the Noise</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  Thanks to my spiritual foundation — thanks to my mom — I learned to
  quiet the noise and let God lead me through the journey. I didn’t quit.
  But I did listen to wise advice: if AI can act like a junior developer,
  then it’s time for you to level up and think like a mid-level or senior
  developer. That mindset shift changed everything.

  Using AI as a Partner, Not a Crutch
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  I dove deeper. I studied prompt engineering. I built GPTs. I trained my
  own AI assistants — one that acts like a senior developer for
  mentorship, another that acts like a junior for boilerplate code. I
  don't blindly copy-paste code. I let AI assist where it saves time —
  while I own the architecture, the creativity, and the heart of the
  project.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
  Grow With It, Don’t Hide From It
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  AI isn’t something to fear. It’s something to grow with. It learns you.
  It adapts to your style. It becomes a reliable partner — but only if you
  stay in the driver’s seat. Don’t let fear freeze you. Embrace AI as a
  tool to amplify who you already are, not erase it.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-12">
  The future isn't about who gets replaced — it’s about who evolves. Stay
  in the game. Embrace the change. Use AI to elevate your craft, not
  escape from it.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
