<h3 className="italic text-center mb-12">
  You might have problems — but your problems don’t have you.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  James Fortune said it best: <span className="font-semibold italic">“Live through it.”</span>  
  That line isn’t just encouragement — it’s a declaration. A mindset. A reminder that the pain you’re feeling doesn’t get the final say. That the storm you’re in isn’t the story's end. That even when it’s dark, you’re not defeated.

## You’re Not What You're Going Through

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Life will test you. You’ll face breakdowns, setbacks, delays, and disappointments. But hear this: what you’re facing is *real* — but it’s not *final*.
</h3>

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4 italic text-xl mb-8">
  "Your situation might look bad — but it’s working for your good."
</blockquote>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Read that again. Slowly. It’s working for your good. Not because it feels good, but because it’s shaping you for what’s next. Sometimes the breakthrough comes *through* the breakdown.
</h3>

## This Is Not the End

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Living through it doesn’t mean pretending everything’s okay. It means choosing to keep showing up even when it’s not. It means trusting that there's purpose in the pressure, and peace on the other side of the process.
</h3>

<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
  <li>You’re allowed to cry. Just don’t quit.</li>
  <li>You can rest. Just don’t retreat.</li>
  <li>You can feel it fully. Just don’t let it define you.</li>
</ul>

## Your Faith Is a Weapon

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Every time you choose to keep going — you’re winning.  
  Every time you speak life when your mind wants to spiral — you’re growing.  
  Every time you say, “I’m not there yet, but I’m not stuck either” — you’re walking in power.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  You’re not just going through it. You’re *growing through it*. Keep living. Keep walking. Keep trusting.  
  **Live through it.**
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
</h3>
