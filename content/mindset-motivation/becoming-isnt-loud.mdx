<h3 className="italic text-center mb-12">Real growth doesn't always announce itself — but it's happening.</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  So let’s say you know who you are. You know where you’re going. You’ve been moving with intention, putting in the work, staying faithful to the process. But it still feels like nothing is happening. What's going on?
</h3>

## Progress Isn’t Always Public

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Just because others can't see the results yet doesn't mean the process isn't working. Becoming isn’t a constant celebration. It’s often quiet, internal, and slow. Growth happens underground before it ever blooms above the surface.

## Delayed Doesn’t Mean Denied

<h3 className="mb-8">
  You might be the senior agent, peer coaching, pouring into your team — and then watch someone else get the Quality Coach position you dreamed about. It stings. But it doesn’t cancel your growth. Sometimes what looks like a setback is actually a setup for something greater. Three months later, a Team Lead role opens — and now you're not just coaching, you're leading.
</h3>

## Your Journey Is Personal

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Becoming isn't a race for attention. It's a journey of obedience, patience, and faith. Your path doesn't have to look flashy to be meaningful. Stay faithful to the version you're growing into — and trust that in due time, everything will align exactly how it’s meant to.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  Keep showing up. Keep believing. Your becoming is real, even when it’s quiet. Don’t give up on yourself.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
