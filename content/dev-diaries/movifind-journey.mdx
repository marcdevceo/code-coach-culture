  This isn’t just another project — this is proof I’m really doing this.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  MoviFind started out as just an idea. Actually — not even that. It was just
  some images, titles, and a rough concept that I wanted to make feel like
  Netflix... but mine. That first version let you discover movies, but let’s be
  honest — that’s all it did. Now? This app provides real value.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Better Tools, Better Vision</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  This new version uses TMDB — a powerful API that makes discovering relevant
  movies easier and more personalized. Users can filter by genre, watch
  trailers, and explore featured content. It’s no longer just a project — it’s
  an experience. And it's one I built from the ground up with pride.

  "You can't tell me I'm not a Software Developer anymore. I'm walking in it."

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">I’m Not Doing This Alone</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  What changed the game for me? ChatGPT. My AI partner helps me understand
  boilerplate code, spot what’s reusable, and refactor it into something that
  reflects my style. I’m not copying code — I’m learning from it, shaping it,
  owning it. I’m not alone in this journey anymore. I’ve got backup — and it’s
  made me stronger.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">I Am the Senior in Charge</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  In the world, I may still be considered a Junior Developer. But in my house,
  I’m the Senior in Charge. I decide the architecture. I pick the tools. I ship
  the features. I debug, I deploy, I repeat. And more than that — I love it.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-12">
  MoviFind is only the beginning. I’m building projects that mean something. I’m
  growing as a developer. I’m proud of where I am and excited about where I’m
  headed. This is just one chapter — and trust me, the story gets better from
  here.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
