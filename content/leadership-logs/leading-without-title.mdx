<h3 className="italic text-center mb-12">
  True leadership isn't granted by position — it's earned through impact.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  What if the greatest leaders were never officially called "leader" at all? What if your influence didn't depend on your title — but on your character, your courage, and your consistency?
</h3>

## The Myth of Authority

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Titles create structure, but they don't create respect. People may follow a title out of obligation, but they follow a person out of belief. Real authority is built on trust, example, and the ability to make others feel seen.
</h3>

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4 italic text-xl mb-8">
  "Leadership is less about your seat at the table and more about how you serve those around it."
</blockquote>

## Influence Starts Within

<h3 className="mb-8">
  You don't have to wait for permission to lead. You lead by how you show up: the standards you hold, the integrity you move with, and the energy you bring to every room. Influence is the quiet force that changes culture long before titles ever catch up.
</h3>

## Opportunities Find Leaders

<h3 className="mb-8">
  When you lead without a title, you create momentum. You become the person others rely on, seek advice from, and rally around. Promotions, recognition, opportunities — they naturally gravitate toward those who lead well without needing the spotlight.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  Titles may open doors, but character builds legacies. Lead right where you are — and watch what opens for you.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
