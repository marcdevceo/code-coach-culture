  Tension doesn't have to break a team — it can build a stronger one.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Tension in a team is inevitable. But what if it wasn't a threat? What if tension was actually the raw material for deeper trust, better communication, and unshakable unity?
</h3>

## Tension Is Information, Not an Enemy

<h3 className="mb-8">
  When tension shows up, it's telling you something: a need is unmet, a boundary is being tested, or a value is being challenged. Leaders who treat tension as valuable feedback — not failure — set the stage for transformation.

  "Tension handled with care turns friction into fuel."

## Redirection, Not Repression

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Ignoring tension doesn't make it disappear — it just buries it until it explodes. Great leaders address it directly, reframe it as shared growth, and channel it into honest conversations that strengthen the team instead of splintering it.
</h3>

## Trust Is Built in the Hard Moments

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Teams don't bond over easy days. They bond when they face hard truths with courage, respect, and unity. Every moment of tension is an opportunity to prove that trust isn't just a slogan — it's a lived experience.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  Don't run from tension. Redirect it. Use it to forge a team that trusts deeper, fights smarter, and rises stronger — together.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
