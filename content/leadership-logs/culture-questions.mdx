  The right culture isn't built by statements — it's sparked by curiosity.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Culture isn't something you declare. It's something you design — and every question you ask lays another brick in that foundation. If you want better results, better trust, and better teams, it starts with the questions you're willing to ask.
</h3>

## Questions Define What Matters

<h3 className="mb-8">
  What you ask about is what you signal is important. When leaders ask questions about growth, support, well-being, and purpose, they show the team where the spotlight truly is. Questions reveal priorities faster than any mission statement ever could.
</h3>

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4 italic text-xl mb-8">
  "Show me your questions, and I'll show you your culture."

## Curiosity Builds Connection

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Authentic questions create authentic relationships. When you take the time to genuinely ask, "How are you?" or "What do you need to succeed?", you're not just gathering information — you're building trust. Connection deepens where curiosity lives.
</h3>

## Great Leaders Ask, Then Listen

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Asking powerful questions is only the beginning. True leadership shines in the pause — in the willingness to listen without defending, fixing, or rushing. Listening turns questions into culture change.
</h3>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  If you want to shape your team's future, start by shaping your conversations. Culture rises or falls with the questions you dare to ask.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
