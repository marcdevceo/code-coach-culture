<h3 className="italic text-center mb-12">
  If your frontline team wasn’t in the room, don’t be surprised when your policy falls flat.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  One of the quickest ways to lose trust, kill efficiency, and spark confusion is to roll out a process that sounds good on paper but crumbles in practice. Why? Because the people who have to implement it weren’t part of creating it.
</h3>

## Policy Without Partnership Is a Problem

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Operations isn’t just about systems — it’s about flow. And flow breaks down when you design in isolation. When the folks doing the work aren’t consulted, you create policies that miss real-world friction, context, and edge cases.

  "The best SOPs are built in partnership, not behind closed doors."

## Frontline Feedback Is a Strategic Advantage

<h3 className="mb-8">
  Your frontline team knows where the process breaks before the data does. They see what’s unclear, what slows things down, and what makes customers frustrated. Tapping into their insights isn’t just kind — it’s strategic.

<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
  <li>They catch what leadership misses.</li>
  <li>They uncover workarounds you didn’t plan for.</li>
  <li>They make the rollout smoother and the adoption faster.</li>
</ul>

## Inclusion Drives Execution

<h3 className="mb-8">
  If you want your procedures followed, invite the people who follow them to help shape them. It's that simple. Ownership increases when people feel seen, heard, and respected — not dictated to.
</h3>

<h3 className="mb-8">
  This doesn’t mean you need to run every idea through a committee. But it does mean building a feedback loop before you finalize the plan. Input doesn’t slow you down — it saves you from rework.
</h3>

## TL;DR for the Strategy-Minded

<ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
  <li>Policies built without input = problems built in.</li>
  <li>Frontline feedback is a form of operational intelligence.</li>
  <li>Inclusion isn’t about permission — it’s about precision.</li>
  <li>Execution improves when people help shape what they’re executing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="font-semibold mt-12">
  If your strategy doesn’t start with the people, it’ll stall with the people. Build with them, not around them.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
