  Your code shouldn't just work — it should connect.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  When I first learned how to code, it was all about the technicals —
  getting the syntax right, avoiding errors, sounding like a "real"
  developer. But somewhere in the process, I forgot the most powerful part
  of who I was: a communicator, a leader, someone who understood people. My
  code was technically correct — but it had no heart.

  Coding Isn't Just Technical — It's Personal
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  I spent years in customer service, understanding what people need and
  how they feel. That experience wasn't a distraction from coding — it was
  my secret weapon. When I finally let my instincts for empathy,
  communication, and creativity into my development work, everything
  changed. My web apps weren't just "functional" — they started to feel
  alive.

  Culture Starts Within You
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  When most people think of "culture," they think of the people and
  environment around them. But real culture starts internally — with your
  identity, your morals, your creativity, your voice. You don't have to
  code like everyone else. You don't have to sound like them. You have
  something uniquely powerful to offer. Let your perspective shape your
  product.
</h3>

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
  Let Your Light Shine Through Your Code
</h2>
<h3 className="text-lg mb-8">
  I started creating better web apps the moment I stopped hiding behind
  "perfect" code and started having fun with it. Customers aren't just
  buying functionality — they’re buying connection. They want products
  that feel human, intuitive, vibrant. Your light, your culture, your
  leadership — that's what makes good code unforgettable.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-12">
  Don't just write code. Write culture. Build experiences that work — and feel alive.
</h3>

<h3 className="text-center text-md text-gray-700 mt-16">
  Keep building with clarity, confidence, and culture.
